Includes an RStudio Addin to replace all German Umlaute in active RStudio document. E.g.

ä -> ae,

Ü -> Ue

ß -> ss

Install the package, restart RStudio and then you should have the corresponding addin available in RStudio.

I mainly use this for interactive RTutor Problemsets that are written in German. Since not all students will by default open their RMarkdown document in UTF-8 encoding, Umlaute are problematic.
